The best depends on what you want, I would choose the normal concert grand and the realistic one, with or without reverb.
The High-pass and Low-pass filter ones are not really useful for live playback and may not be supported by BASSMIDI and Synthfont.
If you are deciding to play a sad song, choose one of the deep presets. 
If you're wanting ultra realism, go for the keppy edition. This has almost no effects applied and thus uses the original sound.

And that's it for now :P
